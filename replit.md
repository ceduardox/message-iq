# WhatsApp Mini Inbox MVP

## Overview

This is a WhatsApp Cloud API inbox application that allows users to receive and send WhatsApp messages through a web-based admin panel. The application connects to Meta's WhatsApp Business API via webhooks to receive incoming messages and uses the Graph API to send outgoing messages. It provides a real-time conversation management interface with support for text messages, images, labels, and quick message templates.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **Routing**: Wouter (lightweight client-side router)
- **State Management**: TanStack React Query for server state with polling (8-second intervals for real-time updates)
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui component library built on Radix UI primitives
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom CSS variables for theming
- **Build Tool**: Vite with React plugin

The frontend follows a single-page application pattern with protected routes. Authentication state is managed through React Query, and the main inbox interface uses a resizable panel layout for desktop with a responsive mobile view.

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express
- **Language**: TypeScript (ES modules)
- **Session Management**: express-session with MemoryStore
- **API Structure**: RESTful endpoints defined in shared route schemas with Zod validation

The server handles three main responsibilities:
1. Webhook endpoints for Meta's WhatsApp Cloud API (verification and message receiving)
2. REST API for the admin panel (conversations, messages, labels, quick messages)
3. Proxy for WhatsApp media files

### Data Storage
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Drizzle ORM
- **Schema**: Eight main tables - conversations, messages, labels, quick_messages, ai_settings, ai_training_data, ai_logs, agents
- **Migrations**: Drizzle Kit for schema management (`npm run db:push`)

### AI Agent Integration
- **AI Provider**: OpenAI GPT-4o-mini via official SDK
- **Auto-Response**: When enabled, automatically responds to incoming WhatsApp messages
- **TTS Provider Selection**: Choose between OpenAI and ElevenLabs for text-to-speech
  - OpenAI: Basic (tts-1) and realistic (gpt-4o-mini-tts) voices with speed/instructions control
  - ElevenLabs: Ultra-realistic voices fetched from user's ElevenLabs account via Replit connector
  - Admin UI shows provider selector and corresponding voice list
  - Setting stored in ttsProvider field ("openai" or "elevenlabs") in ai_settings table
- **Audio Transcription**: Uses OpenAI Whisper to transcribe voice notes, AI responds based on transcription
  - Downloads audio from WhatsApp, transcribes with whisper-1 model (Spanish)
  - Shows transcription in chat as "[Audio]: 'transcription text'"
  - Passes transcription directly to AI for intelligent response
- **Product Database**: Individual products stored with name, keywords, description, price, image URL
- **Smart Product Search**: AI searches products by name/keywords, only includes matching products in context
- **Accent Normalization**: Search handles Spanish accents (berberina = berbérina)
- **Conversation Context**: Reviews last 3 messages for efficiency
- **Image Responses**: Can send images via URL using [IMAGEN: url] format
- **Logging**: All AI interactions logged for debugging (tokens used, success/error status)
- **Settings Page**: /ai-agent route for enabling/disabling, setting system prompt, and managing products
- **Configurable Model Settings**:
  - maxTokens: Adjustable 50-500 (default 120) - controls response length
  - temperature: Adjustable 0-100 (default 70) - controls creativity (0=precise, 100=creative)
  - model: Selectable GPT-4o-mini, GPT-4o, or GPT-4 Turbo
  - maxPromptChars: Adjustable 500-10000 (default 2000) - max characters in agent instructions
  - conversationHistory: Adjustable 1-20 (default 3) - how many previous messages AI reads for context
- **Token Optimization**: 
  - Only includes matching products (~400-600 tokens) instead of full catalog
  - Falls back to catalog text field if no products in database
  - Strict response rules: 2-5 lines max, max 2 questions, human tone
- **Smart Context Loading**:
  - AI first uses instructions/system prompt
  - Only searches products if user message mentions product-related keywords
  - Loads only matching products, not entire catalog

### Push Notifications (OneSignal)
- **Provider**: OneSignal Web Push SDK v16
- **App ID**: 07dfe1e4-83b1-4623-b57c-e6e33232d4eb
- **Trigger**: Sends push notification when new WhatsApp message arrives
- **Content**: Shows contact name as title, message preview as body
- **Unique notifications**: Each message creates a separate notification (no grouping)
- **Service Worker**: OneSignalSDKWorker.js in public folder

### Authentication & Agent Management
- **Admin Login**: Username/password against environment variables (ADMIN_USER, ADMIN_PASS)
- **Agent Login**: Agents created by admin, login with username/password stored in agents table
- **Roles**: "admin" (full access) and "agent" (inbox only, sees assigned conversations)
- **Session**: express-session with MemoryStore, 30-day duration
- **Agent Management** (/agents page, admin-only):
  - Admin creates agents with name, username, password, weight
  - Activate/deactivate agents with toggle (deactivated = can't login, convos redistributed)
  - Weight-based auto-distribution: weight determines proportion of conversations assigned
  - Example: Agent with weight 3 gets 3x more conversations than agent with weight 1
  - New conversations auto-assigned in webhook to agent with lowest ratio (convos / weight)
  - Agents only see their assigned conversations
  - Agents cannot access AI config, follow-up, analytics, or agents pages
- **API Endpoints**:
  - GET/POST /api/agents - list/create agents (admin only)
  - PATCH /api/agents/:id - update agent (admin only)
  - DELETE /api/agents/:id - delete agent and reassign convos (admin only)
- **Access Control**: requireAdmin middleware for admin-only routes, conversation filtering for agents

### Order Management (Call Center Features)
- **Order Status Field**: conversations.orderStatus ('pending', 'ready', 'delivered', null)
- **Visual Indicators**: 
  - Green highlight and checkmark icon for "ready to deliver" orders
  - Yellow icon for "pending" orders
  - Blue truck icon for "delivered" orders
- **Auto-detection**: AI marks orders as "ready" when it detects complete order info (product, quantity, address)
- **Manual control**: Dropdown in chat header to change order status
- **Location Recognition**: Webhook detects location/GPS messages and passes them to AI as delivery address

### AI-to-Human Handoff
- **AI Disabled Toggle**: Per-conversation aiDisabled field to switch to human mode
- **Needs Human Attention**: Flag set when AI responds with [NECESITO_HUMANO] marker
- **Visual Indicators**:
  - Red border and AlertCircle icon in conversation list when attention needed
  - Bot/BotOff toggle button in chat header
  - Clear attention button to dismiss alerts

### AI Learning System
- **Learn from Conversations**: Users can analyze conversations and extract sales strategies as rules
- **Learn Button**: Lightbulb icon in chat header opens modal to:
  - Enter focus/topic for what to learn (e.g., "how I closed the sale")
  - Select number of messages to analyze (5-50 via slider)
  - AI generates suggested rule, user can edit before saving
- **Learned Rules Table**: Stores rules with id, rule text, learnedFrom, conversationId, isActive, createdAt
- **Rules Management**: /ai-agent page shows all learned rules with:
  - Toggle to enable/disable each rule
  - Edit and delete buttons
  - Origin and creation date display
- **AI Integration**: Active learned rules are automatically included in the AI system prompt
- **Endpoints**:
  - POST /api/ai/learn - analyzes conversation and returns suggested rule
  - GET /api/ai/rules - list all learned rules
  - POST /api/ai/rules - save new rule
  - PATCH /api/ai/rules/:id - update rule text or isActive status
  - DELETE /api/ai/rules/:id - delete rule

### Automated Re-Engagement (Follow-Up Automático)
- **File**: server/follow-up.ts

- **Conditions**: Last message is outgoing, status "read" or "delivered", 20+ min elapsed, no prior follow-up, within 72h Meta window
- **AI-Powered**: Uses generateAiResponse with a system prompt to create personalized re-engagement messages
- **Limits**: Maximum 1 follow-up per conversation (tracked via lastFollowUpAt field)
- **Settings**: followUpEnabled toggle + followUpMinutes slider (5-60 min) in AI Agent page
- **Exclusions**: Skips conversations with AI disabled, delivered orders, or older than 72h

### Follow-Up & Call Management
- **Follow-Up Page**: /follow-up route to manage unresponded conversations
- **Time Filters**: Filter by today, yesterday, before yesterday
- **Purchase Probability Analysis**: AI analyzes conversation to rate ALTA/MEDIA/BAJA purchase likelihood
